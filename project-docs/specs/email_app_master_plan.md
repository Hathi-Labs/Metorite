## 1. Product vision — who this is for and what "done" means

**The customer today is one founder running their company from one Outlook mailbox.** The app is
not a webmail clone; it is an **AI chief-of-staff for email**. "Fully featured" means the
customer can trust it to:

1. **Triage without supervision** — every arriving message gets one honest classification;
   conversations are never splintered; bulk mail is filed or killed.
2. **Surface only what needs a human** — Reply Zero, follow-ups, and the digest tell the truth
   about what's waiting, with numbers that are never fabricated.
3. **Draft in the customer's own voice** — replies that need light edits, not rewrites, learned
   from real sent mail (not from correspondents' quoted text).
4. **Close loops** — a promise made in a sent reply becomes a tracked task; a thread awaiting a
   reply nudges at the right time; nothing falls through.
5. **Act safely** — nothing outbound or destructive happens without explicit confirmation;
   automation failures are visible, never silent.

**Trust is the product.** The 2026-07 review's core finding: the architecture is sound (no P0s)
but several surfaces *lie* — a Fix that saves and says it didn't, a sweep that fails and reports
success, a digest counting all-time threads as "awaiting your reply", APPLIED audit rows that
never reached the mailbox. Phase 1 exists because a customer who catches the product lying once
stops delegating to it. That is the PM lens for everything below: **honesty first, convergence
second, new capability third.**

### Explicit non-goals (reset from the old spec)
- **Multi-account / multi-provider parity is not a near-term goal.** The old success criterion
  "Connect 2+ Gmail + 1+ Microsoft accounts" is retired. Gmail and IMAP code stays (latent,
  test-covered where cheap) but no feature work targets them until a second real account exists.
- **Inbound SMTP receiving** — dead subsystem, removing (§6 decisions).
- **Inbox-zero feature-checklist parity as an end in itself** — parity was the scaffolding;
  the roadmap now optimizes for this customer's jobs, not the reference app's feature list.

---

## 2. Current state (condensed; details in the archived inventory + review)

**Architecture** (verified sound by the review): Next.js `/email` app (34 components) →
FastAPI `routes/email/` layered package (`core` / `transport/` / `automation/` / `digest`,
~16.3k lines) → `email_ingestion` service (provider abstraction, per-account async sync loop,
post-sync hook registry) → Postgres (migrations 17→87 — *Update 2026-08-01, doc-truth pass:
"17→87" was the range as of 2026-07-22; later phases added 88 (attachments dedupe), 89
(`internet_message_id`), 90 (snooze), 93 (Needs-Reply rename) and 119 (`email_contacts`,
§3.14), and the repo migration head is 140+ — per the numbering rule, never take a "next
free number" from a spec, only from `infra/postgres/`*). One MAF agent (42 tools), dual-surface
chat. Single-writer seams verified: one message upsert, one rule matcher, one LLM-JSON choke
point, one label writer, one signature assembler.

**Feature verdicts from the 2026-07-22 review:**

| Feature | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Classification core (engine/rules) | Sound — no drifted matcher copies |
| Runner / Reply Zero modules | Working, needs mechanical split (2,116 / 1,971-line files) |
| Inbox Cleaner | Sound — principled evidence ladder; 5 targeted fixes |
| Learned patterns | Sound design + one live bug (silent-save Fix) |
| Drafting / writing style | Real 5-layer system; learning inputs quote-polluted |
| Knowledge base | Real but naive (recency first-fit, no relevance ranking) |
| Digest | Wired end-to-end; semantically broken in the middle |
| Analytics | Sound; strongest-audited module |
| Search lexical / semantic | Sound / shipped-but-unlaunchable |
| Sync/transport | Sound skeleton; two drifted sync cores |
| Assistant chat | Sound; confirmation gate holes on 5 tools |

**Recently closed (do not re-plan):** #110/#111 one-classification-per-conversation; #112
thread repair; **#113 sweep armistice** (cleaner excluded from NEEDS_REPLY/AWAITING/DONE
threads); the 192 APPLIED-404 mystery (root-caused, #100/mig 86/#102/#103); analytics rebuild
(#99); auto-learn gate rework (#97 + #104); pattern approval (#96 + mig 85); Fix-teaches-
guidance (#105); whole-mailbox cleaner (#78/#91/#93).

**Doctrines that survived audit — do not "simplify" these away:**
- Reply Zero and sender categories are **projections of the rules pipeline**, never parallel classifiers.
- A conversation has **one** classification, re-evaluated per message; FYI status rows are **not** proof of conversation-ness; statused threads are **not the cleaner's to label** (#113).
- A metric ships **only if the user can act on it**; backlogs are levels, not flows.
- Drafts are **never auto-sent**; backfills **never draft** (user directive); live Reply-rule drafting stays ON.
- The sweep **never classifies** — it only projects existing evidence; internal domains are never blanket-labelled; Sent is skipped.
- Chat send tools **fail closed** when non-interactive.
- Local-commit-authoritative for *user* actions, but **provider-first for automation writes** (`apply_label` order; Phase 1 extends this to all rule actions).

---

## 3. Prioritization model

Four phases, strictly ordered by the PM lens from §1:

- **P0 · Phase 1 — Stop the lying** (correctness fixes, hours-to-a-day each; ~1 week total).
  Every item here is a place the product misreports its own behavior.
- **P1 · Phase 2 — Converge the seams** (structural PRs, ~2-3 weeks). Kills whole defect
  *classes* (drifted copies) instead of patching instances; unblocks Phase 3 features.
- **P2 · Phase 3 — Finish the product** (customer-visible features, ~3-4 weeks). What "fully
  featured" actually requires for this customer.
- **P3 · Phase 4 — Harden and scale** (security batch + multi-user prerequisites; ongoing).

Effort: **XS** <2h · **S** ≤1d · **M** 2-4d · **L** ~1wk.

### Remaining work at a glance (updated 2026-07-22, post-Phase-2 + same-day review)

Phases 1-3 are **done and live** (every non-parked item). What remains, by kind:

| Kind | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Live verification** (user, minutes) | Label-learn cycle · manual Sync + Resync · digest send retry (post-#148/#150) · ghost-merge dry→`--apply` · Phase-1 1.3/1.4/1.5 after a real cycle | §4, §5 notes |
| **Parked — dedicated session** (user's call) | 2.5 semantic search deep-dive (also unblocks dormant 3.1 voice few-shot) · 3.3b schedule-send (design ready; the one auto-send feature) | §5 2.5, §6 3.3 |
| **Owner decisions pending** | Build-or-kill batch-delete (§6 table — all six verified still present; one S PR) · manual pattern-add flow (badge exists, no create UI) · read-state push-on-open | §6, §7 Tier 2 |
| **Before any 2nd user/account** | Phase 4 Tier 1 (OAuth owner-binding → session-across-I/O → LLM cap → N+1s/indexes → 401 mid-sync retry) | §7 |
| **Hygiene, fold into next touch** | `followups.py` inline label-mirror → `actions.apply_label` · ~20 hand-rolled provider pairs → `provider_session` | §5 notes |
| **Added 2026-08-01 (doc-truth pass)** — §3.14 contacts follow-ups (shipped 2026-07-27, post-dating this table) | Contact card + `email_contacts` (mig 119) are LIVE; open items: `PATCH /email/contacts/{email}` (manual edit honoring `manual_fields`) · `GET /email/contacts` (paged list/search) · duplicate-merge design (decide BEFORE a Contacts view ships) · avatars (needs extra OAuth scope) · optional post-sync backfill | §3.14 |

---

## 4. Phase 1 — Stop the lying (P0) — ✅ COMPLETE, **MERGED + DEPLOYED** (PR #114, 2026-07-22)

All twelve items done (1.1 was already fixed by PR #113 mid-review). Merged to main as
PR #114 and live on the VPS. 706 email unit tests pass (+10 new); repo-wide CI-blocking
lint (`F821,F601,F602,F502,F7,B006`) and frontend `tsc` clean.

| # | Fix | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Cleaner sweep labels conversation messages | ✅ **PR #113** | `_CLEANUP_SCOPE` |
| 1.2 | `_upsert_rule_pattern` returns True on success (Fix-with-pin no longer says "Nothing was saved") | ✅ `9031ee1` | `rules.py` |
| 1.3 | Cleaner failure honesty: abort live sweep on auth failure; `_sweep_job` stamps error; `failed` counter; UI surfaces the real error | ✅ `e71bed4` | `cleanup.py`, `BulkUnsubscribeView.tsx` |
| 1.4 | Engine tri-state via `LLMUnavailable`; never stamp `rules_processed_at` on an outage; all 5 callers handle it | ✅ `640ddfc` | `engine.py`, `runner.py`, `replyzero.py` |
| 1.5 | Provider-first in `_apply_rule_actions` (a refused action leaves no phantom local folder) | ✅ `a119f2e` | `runner.py` |
| 1.6 | Digest truth: needs-reply from `email_thread_status`; category filter via `canonical_cleanup_category`; preview==sent; UTC-honest labels | ✅ `a49f14c` | `digest.py`, UI |
| 1.7 | `undoSend` restores cc/attachments/artifacts + splits the body back into main+quote | ✅ `fb4a289` | `emailStore.ts`, `ComposePanel.tsx`, `page.tsx` |
| 1.8 | Fail-closed `_confirm_destructive` on the 5 unguarded tools + `@_annotate_risk` | ✅ `9ff75a2` | `agents.py` |
| 1.9 | Quote-strip at all three learning seams | ✅ `f089e11` | `drafting.py`, `assistant.py` |
| 1.10 | `/messages` FTS → `websearch_to_tsquery` (fixes `find_urgent`) | ✅ `50f8e25` | `messages.py` |
| 1.11 | Trust panel split into `repairable`/`permanent_failures`; button gated on repairable; dead "Try again" fixed | ✅ `111eee3` | `analytics.py`, `AnalyticsView.tsx` |
| 1.12 | LLM-failure draft fallback → sentinel on automation paths (human template only interactive) + no Mem0 pollution | ✅ `02b77a0` | `drafting.py` |

**Exit criterion met:** every number, toast, and status the app shows is either true or absent.

**Deferred from 1.4 into Phase 2** (deliberately out of scope for the minimal outage fix):
the `provisional` boolean column replacing the `'· auto'` reason-suffix self-heal marker
(review §3.1 P2-4) — a schema change; fold into 2.2's `classify_and_apply` work.

**Live verification owed on the real account** (1.3/1.4/1.5 need a real sync cycle to
confirm — see memory note on verifying-after-a-cycle).

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Converge the seams (P1)

> **Status re-audit 2026-07-22** (evidence read directly from code, not the plan —
> the table below had drifted badly out of date). Several items were quietly
> completed alongside Phase 1 / migrations 88–90 and never struck here.
> **DONE:** 2.4, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.12. **Schema+code done, one-off remains:** 2.6.
> **PARTIAL:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.7 (specifics per row). **Not started:** 2.3, 2.11.
> **Parked by the user:** 2.5 (see [`email-semantic-search-revisit`] memory).

| # | Work | Kills / unblocks | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 ◐→ | Collapse the two sync cores + label-learning as a post-sync hook. **The DEFECT half is FIXED:** label-learning is revived on the scheduler path — `PostSyncHooks.learn_label_changes` (carries the per-message `(message, old_categories)` captured pre-upsert in `_sync_account`'s persist, since the upsert overwrites categories on a categories-authoritative provider); `run_label_learn_hook` invokes it after commit; the gateway registers `scheduler_hooks.learn_label_changes` → the shared `sync.learn_from_label_change_events` orchestrator. So the scheduler + webhook paths (which poll every ~300s) now learn from manual label changes instead of dropping them. Gated on incremental-only, same as the manual route. **Collapse DONE too:** `trigger_sync` is now a thin wrapper — ownership check + `_run_manual_sync` → `_sync_account` (the ONE core; ~268 duplicated lines deleted, incl. the now-redundant inline learning, which flows through the hook like every other path). `resync_account` routes through the same helper — fixing a latent crash where it called the trigger_sync ROUTE with `user` in the `background` slot (unresolved `Depends` → 500 on every direct resync). Parity tests re-pinned on the single core; `transport/sync.py` is no longer an ingest path (guard added). **2.1 COMPLETE.** | Kills refresh-token loss on manual sync, cursor drift, and revives label-learning (was dead in production — scheduler path never ran it) | M-L | review §3.2 |
| 2.2 ✅◐ | `classify_and_apply()` — centralize match → conversation-resolve → apply → watermark. **DONE (the substance):** match→resolve was already one place (`classify_matches`, `engine.py:832`; run-message bypass fixed; `approved_includes_only` explicit `engine.py:523`); apply+watermark is now ALSO one place — `_apply_matches` + `_stamp_processed_watermark` (`runner.py`) collapse the 4 hand-rolled copies (run-message, process-past, `_run_rules_job`, PENDING-retry). The watermark's "only when the run could act" guard and the `sole_match` learning guard each live in exactly one function; process-past routes through the shared apply+watermark while keeping its DELIBERATE oldest-first raw-match classify carve-out (inline resolve would let a thread's oldest message decide status). **Optional remainder:** surfacing `approved_includes_only`/`resolve` as one explicit policy arg on a single façade (today callers pass their own to `classify_matches`) — cosmetic; not blocking. | The #110 invariant enforced in ONE place instead of 2-of-5 call sites; closes the run-message/process-past bypasses and the unreviewed-pattern blast radius | M | review §3.1, §2.2 |
| 2.3 ✅ | Split `runner.py` → `actions.py` (label writers + `_apply_rule_actions` dispatcher) / `learning.py` (auto-learn gate) / `jobs.py` (already extracted) + routes+jobs staying in `runner.py` (2,344 → 1,735); split `replyzero.py` → `chat.py` (AI chat/quick-action SSE, ~390 lines finally leave Reply Zero) / `followups.py` (reminder scan+job) with the thread-status AUTHORITY + views staying in `replyzero.py` (2,167 → 1,565) — deliberate deviation from a separate `thread_status.py`: every consumer imports the authority from `replyzero`, and a rename adds churn with no concern-separation gain. `runner` re-exports the moved action names so lazy importers + tests keep addressing that seam. **The `LIKE '%sender%'` evidence collision fixed while moving** (`learning._sender_consistent_for_rule` now matches the sender by exact case-folded equality — substring matching let `a@b.com` corroborate/veto `aa@b.com`'s history, corrupting the auto-learn consistency bar). | 4,000 lines of mixed concerns; kills every lazy per-row import; the chat SSE code (~390 lines) finally leaves Reply Zero | M | review §3.1 |
| ~~2.4~~ | ~~Draft transport carries cc/bcc/attachments~~ ✅ **cc/bcc #119, attachments #123** | Killed silent draft data loss AND the three-way native-vs-full-send branching | M | review §3.2 |
| 2.5 ⏸ | Fix embeddings sweep SQL (`convert_to(...,'UTF8')`), align hash semantics, add a real-Postgres test, **enable `email_semantic_search_enabled` in prod**. **PARKED by the user** — deep-dive in a dedicated session (flag wiring + broken sweep SQL + live embed cost). | Semantic search stops being shipped-but-unlaunchable; **prerequisite for 3.1** | S | review §3.3 |
| 2.6 ✅◐ | `internet_message_id` column + `$select` + upsert dedupe + one-off merge of the ghost pairs. **Schema+code DONE** (mig 89 + ingest reclaim). **One-off written:** `scripts/merge_ghost_messages.py` — merges rows sharing a backfilled `(account_id, internet_message_id)`: keeps the richest (classified-then-newest) survivor, carries a sibling's categories/watermark if the survivor lacks them, repoints the SET-NULL FKs (`email_executed_rules`, `email_rule_guidance`), deletes the ghosts (attachments/embeddings cascade). Dry-run by default; reports (does NOT merge) rows still NULL — those must re-sync first to learn their id. **To run (user, live):** sync to backfill ids → `uv run python scripts/merge_ghost_messages.py` (dry) → `--apply`. | Kills duplicate classification of Outlook-rekeyed messages and the ghost rows skewing thread heuristics | M | review §3.1 |
| 2.7 ✅ | Digest = projection — DONE. `_digest_categories` and `_digest_top_senders` no longer run their own SQL: they COMPOSE `analytics._categories` (message categories with the per-thread status fallback) and `analytics._noisy_senders` (mail you neither read nor ever answered) under the digest's own scope predicate (this account, inbox-only, self-excluded) and window — one computation, two projections; the analytics helpers were already scope/window-parameterized, so analytics.py itself is untouched. The configured-category filter became a post-filter on the composed rows (canonicalised the same way). Semantic upgrades disclosed: the category breakdown now matches the Analytics chart (was the `email_senders` rollup, which disagreed), and "Top senders" became "Noisy senders you never answer" (raw volume on a founder's mailbox just lists colleagues). HTML body / empty-suppression / self-exclusion were already done. **Dialogs merged:** ONE self-contained `DigestSettingsDialog` (categories + schedule + send-to-email, self-fetches settings+rules, `onSaved` syncs the embedding screen) used by BOTH DigestView and AI-Settings; both drifted local copies deleted. | Digest stops re-deriving (wrongly) what analytics already computes correctly | M | review §2.5 |
| ~~2.8~~ | ~~`email_attachments` UNIQUE `(message_id, provider_attachment_id)` + dedupe migration~~ ✅ **mig 88 + both inserts (`messages.py:512,668`) name the arbiter** | Closes the dormant Gmail duplication bug at the schema level | S | review §3.2 |
| ~~2.9~~ | ~~Shared `JobTracker` with sequence-token guard; concurrency guard on manual sweeps~~ ✅ **`automation/jobs.py::JobTracker` adopted by cleaner/runner/replyzero; `is_running` guard at `cleanup.py:937,1000` + `replyzero.py:1812`** | Kills the job-clobbering class | S | review §2.1 |
| ~~2.10~~ | ~~Sync-loop exponential backoff + orphaned-`running` sweep; cache `masterCategories`; Graph 429 `Retry-After`~~ ✅ **`scheduler.py::_next_backoff`(cap 3600s)+`_close_orphaned_syncs`; `outlook.py` per-instance `_master_categories` cache + `_MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECS` 429 handling** | Stops hammering a revoked account every 300s; cuts every Outlook label apply from 3 Graph calls to 2 | S-M | review §2.1, §3.2 |
| 2.11 ✅ | `provider_session()` context helper (instantiate → authenticate → persist rotated creds on exit) replacing the boilerplate copies. **DONE (#139 + #144 + #150):** `core.provider_session` async CM (persists rotated creds in a `finally` only on clean exit; `user_email=None` = unscoped background mode via `_provider_for_account_any`). Converged: hydrate, both draft-create handlers, digest test-send + scheduled-send, mailto-unsubscribe, `/send`, drafts upsert/send, cleaner sweep, senders background jobs, and (#150, found in review) `download_attachment` — which had been the one site with NO persist *and* no `authenticate()` at all. **Scope honesty:** ~20 hand-rolled instantiate+persist PAIRS remain (`messages.py` ×5, `folders.py`, `cleanup.py` ×4, `replyzero.py` ×5, `runner.py` ×8, `sync.py::_ensure_subscription`, `followups.py` ×2) — each spot-checked to pair its persist correctly, so no dropped-token defect today; converge them opportunistically when touching those files, not as a dedicated pass. | Credential-rotation safety by construction | S | review §3.1 |
| ~~2.12~~ | ~~Promote the repair script's damaged-threads SQL to a maintained health metric~~ ✅ **`analytics.py::count_damaged_conversation_threads` (shared w/ the repair script) → `data_health.damaged_threads`** | The #110 invariant gets a permanent regression alarm instead of a one-off script | S | review §3.1 |

**Exit criterion:** no behavior-bearing logic exists in two places; every invariant has exactly
one enforcement point.

**PHASE 2 COMPLETE (2026-07-22).** Every item closed: 2.1 (sync-core collapse + scheduler label-learning), 2.2 (one apply+watermark enforcement point), 2.3 (runner/replyzero splits + LIKE-collision fix), 2.4, 2.6 (mig 89 + ghost-merge script — the one-off `--apply` run on live data is the user's call, after a sync backfills `internet_message_id`), 2.7 (digest = projection + one dialog), 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 (provider_session on all write/background paths), 2.12. The single deliberate exception: **2.5 semantic search stays PARKED by the user** (dedicated deep-dive session). Landed as PRs #139, #140, #141, #143, #144, #145, #146, #147.

**Post-completion review (2026-07-22, same day — three parallel audit agents over merged main, findings hand-verified).** The structure held: single watermark writer confirmed (`runner._stamp_processed_watermark` is the only `rules_processed_at` UPDATE in the tree), no import cycles among the split automation modules, re-exports + route flattening correct, digest verified as a true projection (no leftover local aggregate SQL), `_run_manual_sync` delegation semantics verified (ownership check, error propagation, post-sync hook, `full=True` on resync). Three defects found and fixed same-day:
- **#148 (prod 500, user-reported):** the digest commitments query bound `:aid` in both a uuid and a text context — Postgres deduces ONE type per prepared-statement parameter, so it failed on *every* call — and its best-effort `except` left the transaction aborted, killing the next query in `/digest/send` while the preview looked fine. Fixed: single-context bind + rollback-and-log in the catch. **Lesson recorded:** a mocked-DB test cannot catch asyncpg type deduction, and `except Exception: return []` on a shared session is a transaction poison — every best-effort DB catch must roll back.
- **#150:** the same no-rollback pattern in `learning.py`'s two gate probes (directly upstream of the audit-row INSERT on the same session) — patched with rollback + log.
- **#150:** `download_attachment` was the last RAW provider call site (no `authenticate()`, no rotated-cred persist) — converted to `provider_session`.
Remaining hygiene from the review (SMELL, not defects): `followups.py:177` re-implements the local label-mirror append inline instead of calling `actions.apply_label` — fold into the next touch of that file.

## 6. Phase 3 — Finish the product (P2, customer-visible)

Ranked by value to the founder-on-Outlook customer:

| # | Feature | Customer job | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~3.1~~ | ~~**Sent-mail few-shot drafting**~~ ✅ **#131** (code shipped; DORMANT until semantic flag ON) | Draft in my voice | M | `_fetch_sent_fewshot` cosine-matches the account's Sent mail → `<voice>` block. Zero cost when `email_semantic_search_enabled` is off; enabling it (token-costing live sweep) is a confirm-point. |
| ~~3.2~~ | ~~**Conversation collapse in the mailbox list**~~ ✅ **#136** | Triage at thread level | M | `GET /messages?collapse=true` (default for the browse) DISTINCT-ONs the conversation key `COALESCE(thread_id, id::text)`, newest-in-view per thread; total counts conversations. Search stays per-message. |
| 3.3 | **Snooze** ✅ **#137** / **schedule-send** ⏳ | Control timing | M-L | **Snooze DONE (#137, mig 90):** `snoozed_until` column, query-time wake (no scheduler), thread-wide stamp, Snoozed view, right-click presets. **Schedule-send PENDING** — outbound; design ready (send-later table + `deliver_scheduled_sends` post-sync hook + composer UI); the one auto-send-on-live-account item — surfaced to the customer for a go/semantics call before building. |
| ~~3.4~~ | ~~**H6 — Fix strips the wrong label**~~ ✅ **#124** | Corrections stick | S | `remove_label` + `correct_applied_labels` strip the wrong rules' LABEL values off the message + apply the corrected one. |
| ~~3.5~~ | ~~**KB relevance ranking**~~ ✅ **#132** | Grounded drafts | S-M | Lexical relevance ranking (not recency first-fit) via `_load_assistant_about(query=)`, always-on; KB dropped from the thread-status classifier (`include_kb=False`). Embedding-cosine variant deferred. |
| ~~3.6~~ | ~~**Pattern review UX completion**~~ ✅ **#127** (reject in-force / restore rejected) | Trust the teaching loop | S | Deferred: manual pattern-add / `USER` badge, None-Fix exclude re-expose. |
| ~~3.7~~ | ~~**Reclassify that finishes the job**~~ ✅ **#129** | One-click recovery | S-M | Now drains the whole mailbox (loop-until-empty), resumable no-progress stop, JobTracker progress + status endpoint, concurrency guard. |
| ~~3.8~~ | ~~**Rule-path draft context parity** + compose-assist learning~~ ✅ **#125** | Auto-drafts as good as manual | S | Runner routes through `_build_reply_context`; compose-assist stores AI draft; follow-up nudge hydrates; pop-out passes `messageId`. |
| ~~3.9~~ | ~~**History per-message timeline**~~ ✅ **#135** | Audit any message | S-M | `GET /messages/{id}/timeline` — received anchor + each `email_executed_rules` row for the message, chronological; `MessageTimelineModal` off the detail "More" menu. Reuses the audit rows, no new table. |
| ~~3.10~~ | ~~**Calendar context in drafts**~~ ✅ **#133** | Scheduling replies | M | `_asks_about_scheduling` heuristic + `_fetch_calendar_context` (internal calendar = gtd_items hard-dates) → calendar block in the draft prompt only on scheduling asks. External calendar sync stays deferred. |

UI: `DashboardView` (feature key stays `digest`) — needs-reply + waiting-on-them ledgers with click-through (`openEmailById`) and row actions (Mark done via `/reply-zero/resolve`, Snooze-1d), commitments incl. undated, category/noisy-sender analytics. |

**Explicitly deferred** (revisit after Phase 3): AI-scored "Clean" review queue; PDF/attachment
content grounding; attachment auto-filing; meeting briefs; learning from bulk actions;
categorization backfill date-range + coverage report; Gmail Pub/Sub push; richer AG-UI typed
`requires_confirmation` events + rule-suggestion approve card; email-KB → other-agents/Mem0
bridge (needs a scoping design so account-scoped memories stay private).

**Shipped 2026-07-23 (second wave, user-directed):**
- **"Reply" → "Needs Reply" rename** (#168 + #170 hotfix, mig 93): mig rewrites owned data;
  `persist._RENAMED_LABELS` canonicalises at ingest (the categories-authoritative provider
  re-asserts old labels every sync); legacy aliases at every resolve seam. Prod-verified:
  0 old-label / 167 new-label messages.
- **Outlook-desktop quote collapse** (#171): text-heuristic boundary (From/Sent/To header
  block, "On … wrote:", "Original Message") in `quoting.ts` — the Word renderer emits no
  marker ids at all.
- **Fix-anywhere** (#172): FixDialog from any mailbox row's context menu + Cleaner sender
  rows. **Dismiss ≠ Done** shipped (#172): `/reply-zero/resolve dismiss=true` → FYI, tasks
  left open.
- **Uncategorized = state, not label** (#175): pill click recategorizes and branches on WHY
  it failed — no-match (healthy classifier) auto-opens Fix; classifier-down surfaces as a
  backend fault, never "fix your rules". Indicator unwritable at all four category writers;
  fixed #168 regression where `CONVERSATION_LABELS_LOWER` lacked "needs reply" (Needs-Reply-
  only mail counted as uncategorized in every facet).
- **Rules-view unification** (#177): learned patterns nested under their rule in RulesTab
  (same PatternRow as Settings, inline approve/reject/forget); header states the pipeline
  order (patterns → AI → Uncategorized/Fix). Stores stay separate — approval gate (#96/#97)
  and provenance preserved.

**Dashboard v2 candidates** (brainstormed 2026-07-22 with 3.13; each is an owner call):
- **Draft-from-dashboard**: a ✍️ action on a needs-reply row that opens the thread with an AI
  draft already prepared (wire to the existing compose-assist path).
- **Per-thread Nudge** on waiting-on-them rows: one-click AI follow-up draft (the follow-up
  drafter exists; needs a per-thread endpoint + the confirm-before-send gate).
- **AI priority ordering**: rank the reply queue by urgency/importance (sender importance ×
  age × content), not just age — the current oldest-first surfaces dead loops.
- **Click-through analytics**: category chips → filtered mailbox view; noisy senders → Email
  Cleaner row (unsubscribe/block from the dashboard).
- **Morning-brief LLM one-liner**: a single sentence ("2 urgent: X's quote, Y's contract")
  atop the dashboard and the emailed digest — costed, opt-in.

### 3.14 Contact card ✅ (2026-07-27, user-requested) — and the Contacts view it unlocks

**Shipped.** Clicking a display name, avatar orb, or any To/Cc recipient opens a people
card (`ContactCard.tsx`, `GET /email/contacts/card`): identity, signature-derived phone /
title / company / links with per-field copy buttons, correspondence stats (received / sent /
unread / last seen), the sender's category and any Cleaner suppression, and the person's last
three messages as previews that open on click. Wired into the reading pane's sender block,
its To/Cc lines, and every message header in the conversation view.

**The part that matters for later: the card WRITES what it learns.** Every open upserts into
`email_contacts` (mig `119`) — display name, job title, organisation, phone numbers, links,
with `source_message_id` + `parsed_at` for provenance. So the mailbox accumulates a people
directory as a side effect of being read, with no data entry, no directory sync, and no
external service. There is no separate crawl to build and nothing to backfill: the addresses
a user actually looks at are exactly the ones worth having.

Rules the writer already enforces (do not weaken these when building on it):
- **`manual_fields[]` is permanent.** It names the columns a human edited; the signature
  writer skips them forever. Without it, the next mail silently reverts a correction — the
  one failure that would make a Contacts view untrustworthy.
- **An empty parse never blanks a stored value.** A one-line reply with no sign-off leaves
  yesterday's phone number intact.
- **Derived facts are never stored.** Message counts, first/last seen, unread are a live
  query over `email_messages`; freezing them would be wrong the moment mail arrives.
- **The domain guess is display-only.** "acme.com" → "Acme" is shown when nothing better is
  known, and is deliberately never written — it is a guess about the address, not something
  the person told us.
- Rows are per email ACCOUNT and cascade with it (matching `email_senders` /
  `email_newsletters`), so disconnecting one mailbox never deletes another's knowledge.

**Contacts view — what is already there when it gets built:**

| Needs | Status |
|---|---|
| A people store to list / search / sort | ✅ `email_contacts`, populated and growing |
| Per-person detail (title, org, phones, links) | ✅ same table |
| Correspondence stats + recent mail per person | ✅ `GET /email/contacts/card` returns both |
| Group by company | ✅ `idx_email_contacts_org` exists for exactly this |
| Editing a contact by hand | ⏳ needs `PATCH /email/contacts/{email}` writing the field **and** appending its column name to `manual_fields` — the storage contract is already designed for it, the endpoint is not written |
| Listing / searching contacts | ⏳ needs `GET /email/contacts` (paged, `q=`, `organization=`) |
| Merging duplicates (same human, two addresses) | ⏳ undesigned — decide whether it is a `merged_into` pointer or a person-level parent row BEFORE the view ships, because retrofitting identity onto a flat address table is the expensive version |
| Photos / avatars | ⏳ undesigned; provider APIs (Gmail People, Graph) are the only real source and both need OAuth scope the app does not currently request |

**Backfill option** (not built, cheap when wanted): the same parse can run over each account's
recent mail in a post-sync hook, so the directory fills without waiting for someone to click
every sender. Deliberately deferred — it is a body-text scan over the whole mailbox, and the
click-driven path already covers everyone the user cares about.

### Build-or-kill decisions (each needs a one-line owner call)

| Item | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Rule-action `delay_minutes` (stored/edited, never executed) | **Kill the UI knob** until a deferred-action executor has a real use case; the column stays |
| Slack/Telegram draft delivery ("Coming soon" UI) | **Remove the dead UI**; rebuild when a messaging integration exists platform-wide |
| Inbound SMTP receiver (`inbound.py`, no launcher, broken DB URL) | **Delete the subsystem** (git history preserves it) |
| Orphan endpoints: `/email/ai/chat`, `/email/ai/quick-action`, `GET /newsletters`, `POST /artifacts/import` | **Delete** (~250 lines; clients were removed) |
| Dead frontend: `useEmails.ts`, 6 dead `api.ts` exports, ~20 fossil card keys | **Delete** |
| Write-only tables `email_folders`, `email_sync_log` | Keep `email_sync_log` (cheap audit); **drop the `email_folders` mirror write** or start reading it |
| Gmail (1,106 lines) + IMAP (792 lines) providers | **Keep latent**, mark unsupported in docs; no feature work; fix only schema-level hazards (2.8) |
| Unfinished tool merges (M7 `manage_rule`, M8 `manage_knowledge`, M13 `manage_labels`) | **Close the plan at 42 tools** — measured value of further merging is low; delete the fossil card keys instead |
| `Support`/`Unknown` sender categories, `'user'` category-override reservation | Remove from the API vocabulary or build the manual set-category flow in 3.6 |

**Verified 2026-07-22:** every kill-candidate above is *still present in code* — the table records
recommendations, not executed work. Evidence: `inbound.py` exists unlaunched (only its own
docstring references its start function); `GET /newsletters` (`senders.py:465`) and
`POST /artifacts/import` (`send.py:205`) have zero frontend callers; `useEmails.ts` has zero
importers; the Slack/Telegram "Coming soon" block renders at `RulesTab.tsx:1215-1244`;
`delay_minutes` is an editable input at `RulesTab.tsx:1180-1189`; `email_folders` is written at
`folders.py:177-187` and read nowhere. `/email/ai/chat` + `/email/ai/quick-action` are
*deliberately* retained for external callers (in-app clients removed by design) — not part of the
kill batch. **One approved batch-delete PR (S) closes all six.** Also confirmed still open from
3.6's deferral: the manual pattern-add flow — the `USER`/"Manual" badge exists but there is no UI
or API client to create a pattern by hand.

## 7. Phase 4 — Harden and scale (P3)

> **Re-verified against main 2026-07-22** (agent audit, file:line evidence checked): every item
> below is STILL REAL. Ranked by urgency **before any second user/account is added** — today,
> with one trusted user on one account, none of these is an active incident.

**Tier 1 — must land before a second user/account:**
1. **OAuth owner-binding** (`transport/oauth.py`) — 🟡 **PARTIALLY CLOSED 2026-08-04.**

   **What this item did not say, and what it cost.** Ranked here as "not an active incident
   with one trusted user", it *was* an active incident for everyone else. The two Connect
   buttons (`email/page.tsx`, `integrations/page.tsx`) navigated the browser straight at
   `${NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL}/email/oauth/{provider}/authorize` — deliberately, because the
   response is a 302 to the provider and a `fetch()` cannot put a consent screen in the address
   bar. A top-level navigation carries no Bearer and no `X-User-Email`: session cookies are on
   the workbench origin, not `api.*`, and a navigation cannot add custom headers. When
   default-deny landed app-wide (57ec82d9, 2026-07-29) the authorize leg — correctly absent from
   `main.PUBLIC_ROUTES` — began answering `{"detail":"Authentication required"}` to every user,
   before the handler and its `user_email` fallback ever ran. **Nobody could connect an email
   account for six days.** It surfaced only when a colleague tried; the owner's mailbox predated
   the change. `git log -S` finds no commit that ever added the authorize leg to `PUBLIC_ROUTES`,
   so the fallback parameter this item flagged as a *security* defect had, by then, never been a
   working path at all.

   **CLOSED — routed through the BFF, not opened up.** The navigation now targets
   `workbench/control_plane/src/app/api/email/oauth/[provider]/authorize/route.ts`, which runs
   server-side with the session, calls the same gated gateway route with `gatewayHeaders()` and
   `redirect: "manual"`, and re-issues the upstream `Location` as its own redirect. No gateway
   route changed and **no new public surface exists**. Adding the authorize template to
   `PUBLIC_ROUTES` was the tempting repair and is strictly worse than the outage: the handler
   writes `{"user_id": …}` into the state the callback turns into an `email_accounts` row, so
   anonymous + identity-from-a-query-parameter lets anyone bind a mailbox to a colleague's
   account. `tests/unit/test_email_oauth_authorize_wiring.py` pins the template *out* of
   `PUBLIC_ROUTES` for that reason.

   **CLOSED — the identity override.** `user_id` was `user_email or user.email`; it is now
   `user.email or user_email`, so the authenticated identity outranks the parameter and the
   parameter survives only as a fallback for a caller with no header identity. The browser no
   longer sends it at all, and the BFF does not forward it.

   **STILL OPEN.** `oauth_callback` is unauthenticated (no `get_current_user`) and its `state` is
   an unsigned random token. `_oauth_states` (`oauth.py`) is still a module-level in-process dict:
   **every deploy restarts the gateway, so any flow in flight when a deploy lands loses its state
   and the callback fails validation** — the user is bounced to
   `/email/oauth/callback?error=invalid_state` with no explanation. It is also not shared across
   workers, and entries are never expired, so abandoned flows leak forever. Fix remains: signed
   state + verified callback, Redis + TTL. Recorded in `apps/services/gateway/AGENTS.md` and in a
   comment on the dict itself.
2. **Stop holding DB sessions across LLM/provider I/O** — `_run_rules_job` opens one session
   and holds it across the whole message loop including `_llm_json` awaits (`engine.py:747,815`)
   and provider HTTP in the apply path; same in `_process_past_emails_job`. One account = a
   pinned connection for seconds; N accounts = pool exhaustion.
3. **LLM concurrency cap / per-account budget** — per-run bounds exist (run limit 50,
   process-past 2000, 366-day span) but nothing coordinates *across* jobs/accounts; each account
   gets its own perpetual loop task plus user-triggered background jobs. A second account
   doubles uncapped classify traffic. Add a shared semaphore + per-account daily budget.
4. **N+1s + indexes** — `list_accounts` runs one COUNT per account (`accounts.py:63-72`, twice);
   `_load_rules` fetches actions per-rule (`rules.py:118-125`) and is called once **per email**
   in the match loop. Missing: `email_messages(account_id, thread_id, received_at DESC)`
   composite; `email_thread_status.last_message_id` has no FK and no index.
5. **401-retry mid-sync** — providers refresh only at the initial `authenticate()` probe; the
   cached client bakes a static bearer header (`outlook.py:119-130`, `gmail.py:172-183`) and
   never rebuilds on a mid-stream 401 (Outlook retries only 429). A token expiring during a deep
   backfill fails the whole cycle. Fix: refresh + rebuild client + retry once.

**Tier 2 — real but lower urgency (defense-in-depth / polish):**
- **SSRF DNS-rebind**: unsubscribe fetcher (`senders.py:586-644`) and image proxy
  (`attachments.py:74-104`) both resolve-then-refetch by hostname; redirect-based SSRF is
  already closed (manual per-hop revalidation), the residual is the rebind TOCTOU. Fix by
  pinning the resolved IP into the transport.
- **Webhook `clientState`** (`sync.py:346`): NULL stored state accepts unverified notifications;
  `!=` not `secrets.compare_digest`. Impact ceiling is a forced sync, not data injection.
- **Workspace path containment**: three `startswith` sites (`send.py:78,227`,
  `actions.py:200`); `.resolve()` already kills `../`, residual is the sibling-prefix case →
  `Path.is_relative_to`.
- **Read-state on open is local-only** (`messages.py:617-624`, no provider write-back on the
  implicit mark-read; explicit PATCH *is* two-way). Decide: push on open, or drop the stale
  "two-way" comment. Outlook star support decision (local-only today).
- Sanitize provider error text before persisting/surfacing.
- Agent config hygiene: regenerate `config.json` `own_tool_scope` from `_TOOLS`; fix
  `instructions.md` references to ungranted tools.
- BYOK `run_agent` (non-streaming) DeepSeek-primary (mirror the streaming pre-injection block).
- Opportunistic: converge the ~20 remaining hand-rolled provider instantiate+persist pairs onto
  `provider_session` when touching their files (see 2.11 scope note).

## 8. Operating rules (unchanged, carried forward)

- **Testing:** every item above lands with unit tests in `tests/unit/` (CI-gated); the review
  showed two bugs (silent-save Fix, embeddings SQL) that existed *because* tests mocked the
  seam under test — prefer exercising the real function/SQL. Integration tests opt-in;
  Playwright e2e for UI. Deploy gate = `pytest tests/unit/` (one red test silently blocks
  deploy — check `gh run list` after pushing).
- **CI reality:** pr-check is Python-only (no frontend build — validate `control_plane`
  locally); stacked PRs get zero CI (empty check list ≠ passing).
- **Migrations** auto-apply on deploy; runtime-mutable state lives in Postgres (deploy runs
  `git reset --hard`).
- **Docs:** this file is the plan; the review is the evidence; archive is history. When a
  phase item ships, update its row here (strike + PR#) rather than writing a new doc.
